This repository contains codes corresponding to my paper titled: "Dynamic sampling of images from various categories for classification based incremental deep learning in fog computing" published in PeerJ Computer Science. Link: https://peerj.com/articles/cs-633/

The main purpose of this algorithm is a perform a pre-NN training data sampling on the edge device only after which the remaining samples are transmitted to the cloud for training. This helps reduce the tranmission cost between the edge device and the cloud and also reduces the training time on the cloud.

Originally, part of the code runs on the edge device and the remaining part of the code runs on the cloud. However, for the sake of simplicity, both these codes have been combined into 1 file as seen in this repository for the sake of reproducibility.
